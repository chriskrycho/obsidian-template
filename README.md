# Obsidian Vault template

This is just a repo containing relevant [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault settings to get the same overall setup I have on *my* (main) vault, excepting a few things which are specific to the structure of my notes (graph configuration, directory structure, etc.).

To use this:

1. Clone the repo
2. Open it with Obsidian.
3. Add notes to it. You can add them directly or export them from another app as Markdown files.

Bonus: to get *exactly* the same presentation I have, download and install [the SF fonts][fonts] from Apple. My config uses **SF Pro Rounded**, **SF Pro Text**, and **SF Mono**.

[fonts]: https://developer.apple.com/fonts/

That's it!
