# Obsidian Vault template

This is just a repo containing relevant Obsidian vault settings to get the same overall setup I have on *my* (main) vault, excepting a few things which are specific to the structure of my notes (graph configuration, directory structure, etc.).

To use this:

1. Clone the repo
2. Open it with Obsidian.
3. Add notes to it. You can add them directly or export them from another app as Markdown files.

That's it!
